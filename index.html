    <!-- POEM 1 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image1.jpeg" alt="Poetry about abandoned animals">
      <h2>For Every Animal Left Behind, a Piece of Humanity Is Lost</h2>
      <p>
        In the shadows they hide,<br>
        With hunger deep inside.<br>
        For in their innocent eyes,<br>
        Lies a plea for love that never dies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 2 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image2.jpeg" alt="Poetry about childhood">
      <h2>Don't Grow Up, It’s a Trap</h2>
      <p>
        As the sunlight touches my peepers,<br>
        In childhood, we were dream seekers.<br>
        Searching for life’s treasures far away,<br>
        From the weight of adult pleasures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 3 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image3.jpeg" alt="Poetry about strength">
      <h2>You Must Be Strong Enough to Protect Yourself</h2>
      <p>
        They say fear is our greatest weakness,<br>
        Yet I have seen hate become someone’s appraiser,<br>
        Judging souls as inadequate,<br>
        Leaving scars where strength should gather.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 4 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image4.jpeg" alt="Poetry about moon and ocean">
      <h2>Bright as the Moon, Deep as the Ocean — Can You Feel It?</h2>
      <p>
        Beneath the moon’s soft, tender glow,<br>
        Waves whisper secrets they long to show.<br>
        In the shimmer of night, love finds its way,<br>
        A blissful dance where hearts gently sway.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 5 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image5.jpeg" alt="Poetry about angels">
      <h2>Do You Believe in Angels? I Do.</h2>
      <p>
        As the angel whispers in my ear,<br>
        A sensation gentle and clear.<br>
        Loving is a gift from the divine,<br>
        Never let go of that sacred shine.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 6 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image6.jpeg" alt="Poetry about morning city">
      <h2>In the Morning’s Quiet Embrace, a City Finds Its Gentle Pace</h2>
      <p>
        Nature’s beauty in this morning scene,<br>
        A peaceful moment, calm and serene.<br>
        As the world awakens, a new day begins,<br>
        With the sun, the birds, and the city’s spins.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 7 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image7.jpeg" alt="Poetry about sky">
      <h2>The Beauty of the Sky Always Leaves Me in Awe</h2>
      <p>
        The sky aglow with colors so bright,<br>
        A breathtaking sight, pure delight.<br>
        In harmony they dance and play,<br>
        Capturing the soul of a brand-new day.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 8 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image8.jpeg" alt="Poetry about mountains and water">
      <h2>Amidst the Tranquil Waters and Whispering Mountains</h2>
      <p>
        Dreamy days and skies so wide,<br>
        Boats and bubbles side by side.<br>
        Come and join the gentle cheer,<br>
        In a land so calm, so dear.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 9 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image9.jpeg" alt="Poetry about family">
      <h2>Family Is Where the Heart Feels Home</h2>
      <p>
        In the silence where echoes softly dwell,<br>
        There’s one who listens, never to tell.<br>
        A haven of calm where fears dispel,<br>
        Yet why orchids he keeps away, I cannot tell.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- POEM 10 -->
    <section class="poem">
      <img src="images/image10.jpeg" alt="Poetry about life">
      <h2>Life Is a Garden, and Every Experience Is a Seed</h2>
      <p>
        As dawn’s first light caresses the snow,<br>
        Mountains awaken with a gentle glow.<br>
        A dance of light on rugged crest,<br>
        Nature’s grand canvas at its very best.
