    <h2>For Every Animal Left Behind, a Piece of Humanity Is Lost</h2>
    <img src="images/image1.jpeg" alt="Stray animal in shadows">
    <blockquote>
      In the shadows, they hide,<br>

      Lies a plea for love that never dies.

      As the sunlight touches my peepers,<br>

      Far away from adult pleasures.

      In the silence where echoes softly dwell,<br>
      There’s one who listens, never to tell.<br>
      A haven of calm where fears dispel,<br>
      Yet why orchids he keeps away,<br>
      I cannot tell.

      A dance of light on rugged crest,<br>
      Nature’s grand canvas at its very best.
