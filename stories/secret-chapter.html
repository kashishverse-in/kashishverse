  <h1>The Whisper in the Mirror</h1>
  <p>
    The protagonist found a thin, leather-bound book in the old library. Its cover was unmarked except for a faint symbol: a circle split into four elements — fire, air, water, earth. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as the book opened, faint letters shimmered on the page. They seemed jumbled, almost meaningless. But for those who were attentive, the words whispered a secret: 
    <span class="secret" onclick="revealClue(this)">“To see beyond, first align what’s broken.” ◉</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The letters shifted as the reader’s eyes lingered, hinting at an arrangement. Something about fire, water, air, and earth… if they were placed in the right order, the next page would reveal itself.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Only the curious, the ones who didn’t rush past, could notice the subtle pattern hidden in the text, leading to the deeper truths of the book.
