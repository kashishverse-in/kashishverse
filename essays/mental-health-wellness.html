    <p>
      Living and learning in today’s world demands constant output. For aspirants and working individuals alike, days often turn into an endless cycle of tasks, deadlines, and expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      When our thoughts are constantly racing, we fail to prioritize recovery. Over time, this leads to cognitive fatigue—a condition recognized in neuroscience and psychology.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deadlines are classic triggers for cognitive overload. While some experience this early in life, others carry it silently for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adequate rest, creative hobbies, journaling, proper nutrition, self-care, and time in nature are not luxuries. They are maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mental health is not about slowing life down. It is about sustaining it.
