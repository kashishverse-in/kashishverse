    <p>
      Technology is transforming education by redefining how knowledge is delivered, accessed, and understood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personalized learning, online platforms, and gamification have made education more flexible and inclusive. Adaptive software, AI tools, and interactive platforms help students learn at their own pace, while maintaining engagement and curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teachers benefit through learning management systems, virtual classrooms, and continuous professional development. They can deliver lessons effectively, track progress, and reach students beyond the classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite its advantages, challenges such as the digital divide, unequal access, and reduced human interaction remain significant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The future of education depends not only on innovation, but on thoughtful implementation that balances technology with human connection.
